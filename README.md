# Blockbond
Blockbond is an AI powered, one-click block explorer generator to enrich and simplify the exploration of all onchain data. Our product is 'Explorer-as-a-service', designed to create a compatible block explorer for every blockchain.
Our product is built for a multichain world, supporting interchain interactions, and allowing new chains to plug into existing data streams from a modular stack. Some of our existing clients include leading L1 and L2 chains like Polygon, Scroll, Base, Aztec, Optimism, Arbitrum, Celestia, and others.

## Product
Our product provides the infrastructure to create block explorers from scratch, combining a data pipeline and an AI application that handles data integration for a new chain. Blockbond guarantees the fastest integration time in the industry, and best in class data latency, ensuring our clients and their users have a seamless experience.

### Our Market
We are a B2B SaaS platform currently serving crypto networks and dapps. Blockbond is aligned with its clients' growth - it's in our best interest to see their platforms flourish.

## Our Work
Some things we try to manifest in our day-to-day:
- Bias for action
- Sense of urgency - favor speed over conviction
- Focus on our customers' success as a core driver for our growth (_"the best way to build a brand is to get more customers"_)
- Not be afraid to ask dumb questions
- Ask for forgiveness, not permission
- Follow your curiosity - use dapps and learn about our ecosystem

### Marketing workbook
Our marketing team is still small, which means we have the advantage of being able to move fast and experiment. Our current objectives for post-launch remain focused on campaigns that build social proof and help refine our product market fit:
- Case studies
- Podcasts
- Blog posts
- Social media marketing
- IRL events, and hackathon sponsorships
- Down the road - kickstart our lifecycle marketing efforts
